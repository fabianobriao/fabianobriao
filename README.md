My name is Fabiano BriÃ£o, and I am from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. 

I am Data Analyst/Statistician and experienced Back-End Python/R Developer.

Job as a freelance scientist and data analyst for a decade, adding experience with scientific research in various jobs, specifically, academics related to operational research, modeling, quantitative and simulation methods.

I perform tasks of: ETL(extraction, transformation, loading), presentation, interpretation, data analysis, modeling, development and validation tests. I teach at universities for engineering courses with descriptive/inferential statistics, algorithms, graph theory and machine learning, applied to engineering.

I'm graduated in Mathematics from UFRG/RS, with a master's degree in Computational Modeling of Knowledge from IC-IMCC-UFAL/AL. I add differentials as certifications, specializations and technology training courses.

For more information, curriculum vitae download in pdf: english or portuguese.
